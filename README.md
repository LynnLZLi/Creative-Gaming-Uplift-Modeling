# Creative-Gaming-Uplift-Modeling

### Project Description:
In this comprehensive project, I was responsible for developing and implementing a targeted marketing campaign strategy using uplift modeling techniques. The objective was to identify the optimal set of customers for a marketing campaign that would maximize incremental profits by predicting the differential impact of marketing on customer behavior. The project involved using various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to perform uplift modeling, comparing their performance, and fine-tuning them for optimal results.

### Technology Stack:
- **Data Handling and Scripting:** Python, pandas, numpy
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, pyrsm
- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib
- **Version Control and Collaboration:** Git, GitHub

### Key Accomplishments:

#### 1. **Data Preparation and Management:**
   - **Dataset Integration:** Successfully integrated two distinct datasets representing control and treatment groups for the marketing campaign. 
   - **Feature Engineering:** Added necessary variables (`ad` indicator) and created a combined stacked dataset (`cg_rct_stacked`) for uplift analysis.
   - **Data Splitting:** Implemented a stratified splitting technique to create training and testing datasets that preserved the distribution of the target variable across control and treatment groups.

#### 2. **Model Development and Uplift Analysis:**
   - **Logistic Regression Uplift Modeling:**
     - Trained a Logistic Regression model separately for the control and treatment groups.
     - Calculated uplift scores by subtracting the predicted probabilities of the control group from those of the treatment group.
     - Analyzed the model’s performance by calculating uplift percentages and incremental uplift, and visualized the results using uplift plots.
   
   - **Random Forest Uplift Modeling:**
     - Developed and fine-tuned a Random Forest model using hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
     - Compared the performance of the Random Forest uplift model with the propensity model and evaluated the incremental profit generated by each.
   
   - **XGBoost Uplift Modeling:**
     - Implemented an XGBoost model for uplift prediction and fine-tuned it by adjusting key hyperparameters.
     - Assessed the model’s effectiveness by comparing the uplift model against the propensity model using both graphical and quantitative analyses.

#### 3. **Performance Evaluation and Optimization:**
   - **Incremental Profit Calculation:** Calculated the total expected incremental profit for targeting the top 30,000 customers identified by each model. This involved determining the uplift for each segment and extrapolating to the entire customer base.
   - **Targeting Strategy Development:**
     - Determined the optimal percentage of customers to target based on each model’s predictions to maximize profits.
     - Compared different targeting strategies using uplift and propensity models to identify the most profitable approach.

   - **Model Comparison and Insights:**
     - **Model Performance:** Evaluated the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models in terms of their ability to maximize incremental profit through targeted marketing.
     - **Model Efficiency:** Identified that the XGBoost model, with its advanced boosting technique, generally provided the highest incremental profit, while the uplift models outperformed the propensity models across all machine learning approaches.

### Key Outcomes:
- **Improved Targeting Precision:** The uplift modeling approach allowed for more precise targeting of customers who were most likely to respond positively to the marketing campaign, leading to higher incremental profits.
- **Optimal Resource Allocation:** The project’s findings enabled the development of a more effective marketing strategy by identifying the exact percentage of the customer base to target, thus optimizing the allocation of marketing resources.
- **Scalability and Adaptability:** The methodologies implemented are scalable and can be adapted to different campaigns or business contexts, providing a robust framework for future uplift modeling applications.

### Summary:
This project exemplifies the practical application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly uplift modeling, to enhance marketing campaign effectiveness. Through the use of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, the project demonstrated how to strategically target customers to maximize incremental profits, making it a valuable contribution to data-driven marketing strategies.
